                    the ability to advertise their price list for deliveries.

            <h4>Employment</h4>
            <p class="lead">
              During my time in employment I have worked on a wide variety of
              different project and websites due to being in a digital marketing
              agency.
            </p>
            <h5>Alloc8tor</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              The main project which I have been involved in is a custom build
              task allocation system running in web technologies. The platform,
              Alloc8tor, was initially developed by another employee within the
              company but then handed to me to maintain and improve. Over the
              years working on it there have been many major improvements as
              well as three different varients of the original product. The
              concept behind the platform is quite simple, there are users and
              an admin team. The admins can go in and ask for jobs to be done
              and the users can respond yes, maybe, or no. Then the admin will
              give whoever they see fit the job.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Alloc8tor utilises Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Alongside this there
              is a NodeJS backend running email integration with Sendgrid as
              well as SMS integration through Twilio. This is all handled on
              Google Cloud Functions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The current main user of Alloc8tor is a group of Anaesthetists
              from Southampton. This year we had moved their invoicing system
              from paper based to be included within Alloc8tor. This allowed
              more security for the client. This set up some new challenges such
              as storing patient data, uploading files, and tracking statistics.

            <h5>MSOS (Medical Support OffShore)</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              This project was small and required me to work in PHP. The task
              was to create a payment gateway between the MSOS website and the
              eRMS API. It automatically works out the VAT of a specific amount
              and deducts or adds it based on the purchase type.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The main difficulty with this project, although small, was that
              the documentation for the API wasn't really accessible as well as
              the customer support not being the most helpful. I spent some of
              the time testing failed transactions to get the correct error
              codes to allow the user to be notified of what the issue was.
              After this it all worked quite smoothly.

            <h5>S2E (Surveyors to Education)</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              The S2E project was to make a user portal for sharing files. It
              allowed me to work fully with different hierarchies of logins as
              well as Google Cloud Storage. The system is a simple design. There
              are users with different permissions based upon what school they
              are attached to or if they are an admin. Files are uploaded to a
              schools folder and any users with permissions for that school can
              view and download these files.
            </p>
            <h5>Nell Health</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              This was a longer project that I was involved in from the start.
              The idea of the entire project was having a payment portal and
              user dashboard. The concept of the product was that a user can go
              to the shop page and either purchase a DNA test, a blood test, or
              a combined test of both. They would then be directed to a payment
              a registration page which would add them to the database as well
              as charge them via Stripe. From here the company would do all the
              necessary steps to acquire the data from labs. The next step was
              to return a custom report based on the numbers given. The report
              worked as a basic number matching system. Three pieces of advice
              were pre-loaded into the database and if the result fell between a
              certain range, then a certain piece of advice was loaded. The user
              had unlimited access to their results and could even print them
              off if they wanted.
            </p>
            <h5>Non Specific</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              Alongside working on specific projects, I have experience in
              working with Google Analytics. I have utilised this tool to work
              with Google Data Studio. I created my own template to include
              every client our company had to send them monthly reports based on
              views and visits per country, clicks and most popular pages. I
              also have experience with DNS and SEO Keyword searches.

            <h4>Personal</h4>
            <p class="lead">
              Here are some of the small projects I have worked on that I either
              finished or mostly finished.
            </p>
            <h5>Radio Website</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              This was less of a personal project and more of an education one.
              During university we had to do a group project. I was in a group
              with one other and we had chosen to rework the website for the
              website of the school. Our approach was to use PHP as this was the
              most proficient language of us.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The website only allowed for an admin to be logged in. The admin
              had access to the song database where they could add/edit/delete
              songs. An unregistered user could come onto the site and request a
              song to be played on the radio. This would be in a seperate panel
              for the admin where they can mark when they have played a song.
            </p>
            <h5>Discord Bot</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              During my initial introduction to the software that was Discord, I
              found out that it was possible to create a bot. This was my first
              adventure into Javascript.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Utilising the developer API provided by Discord themselves, I was
              able to create a basic bot pretty quickly running in NodeJS. It
              only had basic commands at first like checking ping or responding
              to greetings.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I decided to add a MySQL database to the bot at a later point to
              utilise a database for saving data as well as posting data at
              random. It was a fun little addition to get MySQL working within
              NodeJS.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Later down the line I had made another function for playing music
              from YouTube within a voice channel. It featured a small queueing
              system build in so you could add a bunch of songs.
